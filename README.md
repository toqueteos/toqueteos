# Hi, I'm Carlos

Nice to meet you!

I [post about my technology experiments and job-related rants][blog] from time to time.

I also try to give back to the community when I have the time. Lately that's been the DevOps ecosystem.

Currently I'm building a service that I've yet to announce but I'm pretty sure a lot of people might find useful, we'll see about that..
