# Hi, I'm Carlos

Nice to meet you!

I [post about tech (mostly) and job-related rants][blog] from time to time (at most twice a year).

I also try to give back to the community when I have the time.

Currently I'm working on:
- A platform to read & write novels, free & paid
- A browser space game inspired by the 2000s classics (OGame, XWars)
